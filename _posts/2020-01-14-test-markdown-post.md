# No Leaders Please

```python
Invent yourself and then reinvent yourself,
don't swim in the same slough.
invent yourself and then reinvent yourself,
and
stay out of the clutches of mediocrity.

invent yourself and then reinvent yourself,
change your tone and shape so often that they can 
never categorize you.

reinvigorate yourself and 
accept what is 
but only on the terms that you have invented
and reinvented.

be self-taught

and reinvent your life because you must;
it is your life and
its history
and the present
belong only to 
you.
```
