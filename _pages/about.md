Hey!, Iqbal from India. I as currently doing Master's in 'Statistics and Machine Learning' at Linkoping University.
Always trying to update my weights and biases.

![Book](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498732198l/35540648._SY475_.jpg)
- [How to (actually) change your mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35540648-how-to-actually-change-your-mind): A lot of free time and isolation got me started thinking about how to think more rationally, update my prior beliefs after seeing new evidence and work on reducing cognitive biases that I encounter daily. Just Kidding! 
I found it somewhere on Sam Harris's Recommended Reading rabbit hole. I 'bet' you will see Lottery, Odds and Politics from a different perspective.
