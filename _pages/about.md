Hey there! I'm Iqbal from India, currently doing Master's in 'Statistics and Machine Learning' at Linköping University.
Always trying to update my weights and biases.
If you wanna collaborate on some cool projects or just say hi, we can get in touch on [Linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sbiqbal) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MusingIqbal) .

Papers I'm Reading:

- [BART: Bayesian additive Regression Trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3286.pdf) **:** Though pretty old, the paper is quite interesting to read. Chipman Et al. showcase a nonparametric Bayesian Regression approach. It's fast, interpretable and accurate AF(as Forests)! I say let's make BART great again. Anyway, please do give it a read. There's tons of info contained in one paper. I enjoyed it a lot. Also, If you wanna apply the same there are open-source libraries both in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesTree/index.html) and [Python](https://github.com/adamlauretig/pymc_bart/blob/master/pymc_bart.ipynb) that implement it. Juan Martín Loyola has some great articles on the same [here](https://jmloyola.github.io/posts/2019/06/introduction-to-bart) and [here](https://jmloyola.github.io/posts/2019/07/posterior-inference-in-bart).
