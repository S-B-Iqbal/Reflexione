  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hey there! I’m Iqbal from India, currently doing Master’s in ‘Statistics and Machine Learning’ at Linköping University.
Always trying to update my weights and biases.
If you wanna collaborate on some cool projects or just say hi, we can get in touch on <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/sbiqbal">Linkedin</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/MusingIqbal">Twitter</a> .</p>

<h2 id="what-im-re-reading">What I’m (Re)-Reading:</h2>
<p><img src="https://powerseductionandwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mast.png" alt="Book" /></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589182-mastery">Mastery</a>: A few years ago I took a MOOC called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">‘Learning How to Learn’</a> by Barbara Oakley. Though the title sounded a bit clickbaity, it was a phenomenal course that taught things that surprisingly were not a part of any curriculum. She also has a book on the same subject which is much more elaborate and has some really helpful tips and tools. Ever since I took the course I honestly struggled to implement most of her tips. Though I avoid self-help books as much as I can, <em>Mastery</em> is one book that has potentially transformed the way I perceive new problems. Robert Greene is sometimes called ‘Modern Machiavelli’ because of his work on Power, Seduction, and Strategy. But, I do think Greene who is a Zen-Buddist, likes to show reality as it is without sugar-coating the truth. In Greene’s unique style, he takes examples from history to create a Template to achieve mastery in any subject we choose. In conclusion, he writes that one has to pass 4 hurdles to achieve Mastery:
    <ol>
      <li>Boredom: It will go once we enter the learning cycle.</li>
      <li>Panic: It will go after multiple exposures.</li>
      <li>Frustration: It is a sign of mental progress, it will go after persistence.</li>
      <li>Insecurities: We Will turn to securities once we achieve mastery.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the snippets that captured my attention…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience. Their authority in the field is not based on politics or trickery.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many people believe that everything must be pleasurable in life, which makes them constantly search for distractions and short-circuits the learning process. The pain is a kind of challenge your mind presents—will you learn how to focus and move past the boredom, or like a child will you succumb to the need for immediate pleasure and distraction? Much as with physical exercise, you can even get a kind of perverse pleasure out of this pain, knowing the benefits it will bring you. In any event, you must meet any boredom head-on and not try to avoid or repress it. Throughout your life you will encounter tedious situations, and you must cultivate the ability to handle them with discipline.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Leonardo da Vinci wanted to create a whole new style of painting, one that was more lifelike and emotional, he engaged in an obsessive study of details. He spent endless hours experimenting with forms of light hitting various geometrical solids, to test how light could alter the appearance of objects. He devoted hundreds of pages in his notebooks to exploring the various gradations of shadows in every possible combination. He gave this same attention to the folds of a gown, the patterns in hair, the various minute changes in the expression of a human face. When we look at his work we are not consciously aware of these efforts on his part, but we feel how much more alive and realistic his paintings are, as if he had captured reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leonardo da Vinci understood the dangers of such impatience. He adopted as his motto the expression <em>obstinate rigor</em>, which translates as “stubborn rigor” or “tenacious application.” For every project he involved himself in—and by the end of his life they numbered in the thousands—he repeated this to himself, so he would attack each one with the same vigor and tenacity. The best way to neutralize our natural impatience is to cultivate a kind of pleasure in pain—like an athlete, you come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope you enjoy the book…happy Learning!</p>
